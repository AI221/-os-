# [os]
An OS for CC that is aimed at developers, people who share computers, ComputerCraft networks, and soon to be the average user.
---
This is a public beta test, meaning it's a big huge wall with a hole in the middle of it to hackers.

Installer found here: pastebin run 6JU1nY50 5 update

# Warning:
This is in beta. I really wouldn't trust the permission system with important data.
Serously. I know several loopholes in the public versions, and even some in my private versions. It's like an old fashion lock: it will keep teenagers and petty thieves out, but if someone is serous enough, they'll pick the lock in 5 minutes top.
