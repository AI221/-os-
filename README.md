An OS for CC that is aimed at developers, people who share computers, ComputerCraft networks, and soon to be the average user.

This is a public beta test, meaning it's a big huge wall with a hole in the middle of it to hackers.

Installer found here: pastebin run 6JU1nY50 5 update

This is in beta. I really wouldn't trust the permission system with important data.
Serously.
