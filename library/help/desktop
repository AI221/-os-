The desktop is the place that the GUI boots to, by default. Here you can place apps to be easily opened by clicking and releasing. You can arrange the apps in any way you want, by clicking and HOLDING, then dragging your mouse to the position. Once you're in position, RELEASE your mouse and it will stay there. All things on the desktop are located in "desktop/".
